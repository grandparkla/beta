# How to add an image

If you want to add an image (or any file) to the website, you can upload it to one of the folders on GitHub.

The [uploads folder](https://github.com/grandparkla/grandpark/tree/master/uploads) might be a good choice, if you’re unsure where to put a file.

Once you’ve chosen a folder, follow these steps:

1. Press the `Upload files` button

2. Use the uploader to upload your files

3. Press the `Commit changes` button

It’s best to use lowercase letters and dashes instead of spaces for your filename. For example: `dahn-gim.jpg`.

Once your file has been uploaded it be available at a web address that corresponds to the folder and filename that you chose. For example:

```
/uploads/dahn-gim.jpg
```

To use this on the website, you can create an image with [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/):

```
![Dahn Gim](/uploads/dahn-gim.jpg)
```
