## How to develop the website

The website is published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and the files are generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

As you make changes and commit them to GitHub, the [website](https://beta.grandparkla.org) will automatically update.

If you want to see a preview of your changes while you work, you can [run a Jekyll server](https://jekyllrb.com) on your local machine. [Installing Ruby and Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) is a good place to start.

After you have Jekyll installed, you can clone this project with [Git](https://git-scm.com) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)â€¦

```
git clone https://github.com/grandparkla/grandpark.git
```

And then start running the Jekyll application like this...

```
jekyll serve
```
