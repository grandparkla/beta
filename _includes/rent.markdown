## Filming & photography

### Need to film in Grand Park?

Commercial film and photo shoots – including student and non-profit organizations – require a permit from [Film LA, Inc.](https://www.filmla.com/), the entity authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to process film permits. 

Commercial film and photo shoots also need to be scheduled with our rentals team.
