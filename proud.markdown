Part of Grand Park’s ongoing PROUD Series celebrating LGBTQ L.A., the PROUD Story Slam  presents narratives about how Los Angeles connects us no matter who we are or whom we love. From L.A. gay rights pioneers to Angeleno trans comedians, hear amazing stories that transcend geography, generation, gender, race and background. Be prepared to laugh and perhaps even shed a tear.
