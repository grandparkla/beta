  Need to film in Grand Park?
</h3>

Commercial film and photo shoots – including student and non-profit organizations – require a permit from [Film LA, Inc.](https://www.filmla.com/), the entity authorized by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to process film permits. 

Commercial film and photo shoots also need to be scheduled with our rentals team.

Learn about filming in the park and tell us a little bit about your planned photo shoot to help us help you. Please fill out and submit the [inquiry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WXV1JURZdfIIjBqFqwSWOQ8pyboJRp9_0M_zUio4QiE/viewform).
