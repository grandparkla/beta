What time did you wake up today? What do you do for work? How do you prepare your favorite meal? Angelenos can describe moments of everyday life – the sights, smells, and experiences to another place or country. The Portals Project brings an immersive space – a gold shipping container with screens and speakers – to connect Angelenos to faces and places that are curious about L.A. life.  Exchange thoughts, ideas, recommendations for music, recipes, and anything in between in this two-week activation from April 10 until April 23, 2017.
