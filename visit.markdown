### What type of programming takes place?

The park is a dynamic, inclusive environment for community events, cultural experiences, festivals, holiday celebrations and many other activities that engage and attract visitors from all communities in Los Angeles County. Park visitors enjoy original programming, Music Center programming, outdoor activities, interactive events, entertainment and many other activities that benefit from the park’s multi-use lawns, stages and spaces.

### Is picnicking allowed at the park?

Yes. Grand Park was designed for both public and private use. Visitors can enjoy a picnic or purchase food and beverages on site. Certain events will invite food trucks and other food vendors.

### Is the splash pad portion of the fountain open/accessible to the public? Are park visitors allowed to play in the water?

The interactive splash pad is open to the public. Visitors of all ages are encouraged to enjoy water play in the splash pad, which features interactive jets.  

Visitors can enjoy the light show in the park’s Arthur J. Will Memorial Fountain after dark, from the surrounding overlook and walkways, or while passing through to the Metro Civic Center/Grand Park station, a parking lot or an alternate destination outside the park.

### How is the park conserving water?

Grand Park was designed as an eco-friendly park with water conservation in mind. In addition to the native and drought tolerant plants and landscaping, the park has a state-of-the-art irrigation system.

All non-turf areas have drought tolerant plant material and are watered by subsurface drip irrigation that eliminates overspray and runoff. This saves more than 30% of water use compared with conventional overhead spray irrigation. That system includes Flow Sensing and Master Valves that detect breaks in the irrigation system and send alerts so any leaks can be fixed immediately. Plus, the Park has installed “smart irrigation controllers” that adjust watering as result of weather and moisture levels.

The Grand Park fountain uses recirculated water. It is a historic fountain so it is kept running at the lowest possible level to keep the inner workings going and to prevent any corrosion or other problems. It no longer “dances” but is set on “static” mode. The fountain is incredibly efficient and, because it is recirculating, uses only 20 gallons of water per year.

### Can I recycle at the park?

Yes. Visitors will find recycling bins located throughout the park.

### Can I bring my dog to the park?

Dogs are allowed in the park but must be on a leash at all times. A dog run on the Event Lawn (near the Spring Street entrance) offers an off-leash area for dogs and their owners.

### How can visitors get information about accessibility?

Grand Park follows all ADA standards for accessibility. Visitors can call 213-972-8080 for more information.

### How can visitors trust that Grand Park is a safe and secure environment?

Security for the park is provided 24-hours-a-day. In addition, security cameras, monitored daily, are located throughout the park to ensure the safety of all park patrons.

### Are there public restrooms?

Yes. Restrooms are located by the Starbucks between Grand Avenue and Hill Street and in the Event Lawn area near Spring Street.

### Can visitors move the pink furniture?

Yes. Visitors are free to move furniture for use within the same area of the park. Moving furniture across the street to other portions of the park is prohibited.

### Can anyone hold an event at the park? Where is information available?

The park is open to everyone. Individuals, companies and organizations are welcome to rent space for public or private events at the park. If you’re interested in renting a space in Grand Park, please visit the [CONTACT/RENTAL INFORMATION](https://grandparkla.org/contact/) page
